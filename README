This is a repository for my senior project at Cal Poly SLO, which aims to combine front end 
development knowledge and a love for anthropological history. This repository is for an 
interactive art gallery with embedded analyses which goes over the Mexican Revolution in 
the early 20th century, and the art as it reflects this revolution.
