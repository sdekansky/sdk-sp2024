            <p>My name is Sebastian de Kansky. I'm a recent graduate from California Polytechnic State University majoring in Anthropology & Geography, with an interest in technology, statistics, and history. I made this website as part of my Senior Project for Winter Quarter, 2024. The goal of this project was to try web development and explore my Mexican heritage through art and history. You can reach me at my email, sebastiandekansky@gmail.com. You can access this project's github repository
