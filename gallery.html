            <p> Miguel Cabrera’s From Spaniard and India: Cabrera depicts a white Spaniard with his back turned from view, raising his hand as if to lecture or educate his indigenous wife and mixed child. This gesture represents a culture of domestic control common in New Spain, wherein the Spanish father seeks to educate his “newly civilized” indigenous wife. His wife and child receive his lecture passively and earnestly. Furthermore, this painting illustrates a common motif amongst the casta paintings — ethnic sexualization. Men are depicted as white, while women are nearly always mixed, indigenous, or black. Frequently women serve as the focal point of the action within these compositions, wearing nice clothes and presenting them as obedient objects of value. </p>

                From Spaniard and Black, a Mullata is Born: In this painting by an unknown author, we see a chaotic kitchen scene. A white Spaniard fends off his black wife, who grabs his hair and angles a wooden spoon above his head as if to strike. Their mixed child attempts to separate them. Other onlookers within the kitchen, both mixed and black, watch in surprise. This painting depicts a racist stereotype that black women are aggressive, which serves to amuse the white male gaze. Meanwhile, as is common with casta paintings, the mixed child acts as a mediator of conflict. This type of scenario was quite popular amongst the genre.

                Felix Parra’s Chobala Massacre: Completed in 1877, this painting depicts the aftermath of Hernán Cortez’s attack on Chobala, where he and his conquistadores six thousand people whilst on the march to Tenochtitlan. The composition situates Cortez in the center, standing triumphantly in sword and armor as his soldiers loot the city’s treasures. Beneath him, a deceased indigenous man lay at Cortez’s feet in a pool of blood. In some interpretations, Parra painted the slain native in resemblance to Christ’s crucifixion on the cross, symbolizing the irony of Spain’s cruel pursuit of evangelization (Widdifield, 1990). The slain man's wife watches in horror as she holds their presumably deceased child, perhaps representing the permanent alteration of Mexico’s future. Three surviving natives sit next to their scattered possessions in despair.

                Gabriel Guerra's Cuauhtemoc's Torture: This panel was created in 1886 to adorn the larger Monument of Cuauhtémoc in Mexico City. this sculpture depicts Cuauhtémoc, the last Aztec emperor, bound and tortured by Spanish conquistadors. His body contorts in agony as he resists his European captors, symbolizing the collective trauma inflicted upon indigenous peoples during the colonial era. Placed prominently in a public space, the monument serves as a potent reminder of the resilience of Mexico's indigenous heritage in the face of colonial aggression. Guerra uses the act of publicly displaying a violent historical event to confront viewers with the brutal realities of conquest and colonization, while also honoring the legacy of resistance that continues to shape Mexico's national identity to this day.

                José Clemente Orozco’s The Epic of American Civilization: This mural was completed in 1932 for Dartmouth College and is divided into two sections that tell a story of conquest, conflict, and violent transformation of the modern man in the context of industrialization. The first section, The Coming and Parting of Quetzalcoatl, visualizes the story of indigenous people in Mesoamerica, from ancient human migration to a religious prophecy anticipating the conquistadors. One notable panel depicts indigenous leaders who sacrifice a human heart as an offering to the gods in exchange for prosperity, which is referenced again in the second section, Cortez and Modern America.

                José Clemente Orozco’s The Epic of American Civilization: The second section tells the story of Cortez’s first conquest and the evolution of Mexican society, which includes references to industrialization, machines, and Anglo-American influence, and even depicts a heroic portrayal of Zapata and his popular rebellion. In contrast to the human sacrifice in the first section, Orozco includes another sacrifice — that of a soldier who sacrifices himself for his nation. This recurring theme critiques the violent sacrifice made by individuals to preserve the stability of the modern industrial society, which Orozco considers a new religion. Symbols in other panels, such as machine totems and skeleton gods of modernity, reinforce this critique of Mexico’s oppressive system. This epic work serves as an ageless monument to the ongoing struggle for justice and equality in Mexican society.

                Diego Rivera's Zapatista Landscape: The 1915 painting depicts Emiliano Zapata, a revered figure of the revolution, leading a group of armed peasants. The composition uses abstract, cubist shapes to develop the visual language of an emerging Mexican nationalism that embraced indigenous, campesino, and revolutionary elements. Such symbols include a rifle in the center, indigenous serape textiles, and shapes resembling sombreros affixed in front of the Mexican Valley landscape.

                Alfredo Ramos Martinez' Zapatistas: The composition features a group of armed campesinos who are presumably indigenous and mestizaje. They are huddled close as they seem to fight for space within the composition, ready to burst out of the frame. Martinez seeks to comment on the ethnic makeup and sheer number of the peasant class who now seek liberation from a wealthy minority of elites. Martinez also employs a subdued color palette and soft, flowing lines to convey a sense of solemnity and introspection.

                Diego Rivera's Mexico Today and Tomorrow: The composition is teeming with life and activity, depicting workers, peasants, and intellectuals engaged in the revolution. Bold colors imbue the mural with a sense of energy barely contained within a framework of industrial pipes and machinery. Atop the mural is Karl Marx, who guides workers now in search of liberation. Elements such as the hammer and sickle, the gears of industry, and popular conflict with government officers serve to underscore the revolutionary fervor that permeated Mexican society during this period. Additionally, Rivera includes references to Mexico's indigenous heritage, such as the depiction of ancient pyramids and traditional attire, highlighting the cultural diversity and resilience of the Mexican people. Through "Mexico Today and Tomorrow," Rivera offers a vision of a vibrant and egalitarian society, shaped by the ideals of the revolution and the ongoing struggle for social justice.

                Frida Kahlo's My Nurse and I: The painting, created in 1937, is a deeply personal exploration of the artist's own identity and experiences, yet it also resonates with broader themes of revolution and resistance in Mexican society. The composition features Kahlo as a child, cradled in the arms of her indigenous nursemaid, who is depicted with strength and dignity. The contrast between Kahlo's fragile, porcelain-like appearance and the nurse's sturdy, earthy presence highlights the power dynamics at play and the bond of affection between the two figures. In some interpretations, this piece reflects Kahlo’s pain at the loss of her mother, yet we can also extrapolate the greater metaphor at play — the mestizaje acknowledgment of indigenous origin. The wet nurse covers her face with a pre-Colombian mask as if to suggest that she is not singular, but a complete representative of Mexico’s indigenous past.

                Frida Khalo's The Two Fridas: The composition features two versions of Kahlo seated side by side, each holding hands and connected by a vein that merges into a stormy sky. The figures are rendered with detail and emotional intensity, reflecting Kahlo's mastery of self-expression and introspection. The Frida on the right wears a traditional Tehuana costume, representing Kahlo's Mexican heritage and cultural roots, while the Frida on the left wears a European-style dress, symbolizing her European ancestry and connection to modernity. The contrast between the two Fridas highlights the unification between Kahlo's conflicting identities and reveals the emerging nationalistic sentiment regarding this dualism in Mexico after the revolution.

            Diego Rivera's The Flower Carrier: This 1935 composition centers around a laborer burdened with a heavy load of flowers, stooped under the weight of his cargo. Rivera captures the working class's physical strain and emotional resilience, symbolizing their efforts to sustain themselves amidst economic hardship. The laborer carries a weary expression that highlights the toll of manual labor on the human spirit. Behind him, a woman supports his burden, embodying the collaborative efforts of men and women in the struggle for survival. Symbolically, the flowers represent both the beauty and fragility of life, implying the human, natural cost of social inequality.
